I am
writing some notes as we go through the day. Apologies to all of the great things
I've missed in these notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keynote: Luciano Ramalho&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming with a long history of development and teaching experience, Ramalho
discussed his personal history learning to program as well as some of the
exciting tools and methods of teaching programming in classrooms today. Ramalho
humorously recounted his dismal Study Hall experience when he first moved to
the US, and how the installation of Apple ][ machines in the library liberated
him from the doldrums of sitting quietly in a classroom for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramalho asked, appropriately, "Why did only two of us in the whole classroom
take the opportunity to teach ourselves to program?" He discussed with the
audience, which led to lots of ideas about fear of failure or not wanting to be
different from the rest of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think those are all valid points, but I wonder if it was more the result of a
lack of vision: Those kids had no way to understand the valuable benefits they
would get from learning to code. This is something I think many people deal with
today: They don't really know what is involved with writing code, and they have
no idea of how learning to code could be beneficial. It's a reflection of the
poor understanding that people have of coding and software in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me unfair to expect students to be able to realize the benefit of
learning something they have no idea about. It's exceptional when students can
lead themselves to that point, but it's totally understandable why a student
would not be able to get there without help. This is why it's so important to
begin education about coding and software early in our educational careers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Python"></category><category term="conference"></category><category term="education"></category></entry></feed>
